Read my lips but don't you dare reply
Cause I am just a dinosaur
Alive inside a screen
Ring me out and hang me up to dry
I don't believe in dinosaurs
But I know Ghosts are real
There's a ghost in my home
But its better than being alone
Reading read receipts with no replyin
Yes my house is haunted
Thats the way I want it
Read receipts with no replyin
Grab me by the ghost and suck my eyes
I don't believe in animals
Milk comes from the trees
Is you am a spectre of the night
Cause I am just an animal
A strange anemone
There's a ghost in my home
But its better than being alone
Reading read receipts with no replyin
Yes my house is haunted
Thats just what I wanted
Read receipts with no replyin
There's a ghost in my home
But its better than being alone
When you don't light up my phone I'm cryin
Yes my house is haunted
That's just what I wanted
Read receipts with no replyin
Reading read receipts with no replyin
When you don't light up my phone I'm cryin
When you don't light up my phone
